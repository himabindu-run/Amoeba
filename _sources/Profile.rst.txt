Hola! I am **Hima Bindu**.
Being a freshman in the Department of Computer Science here at the GVPCE(A), Visakhapatnam, I'm fascinated by the plethora of domains that I can choose from to explore. Having been a person who's always curious to learn, I'm excited, knowing the power of community learning. With an ultimate aim to serve the man kind and feral bodies with technology I can harness, I wish to learn and make learn. Other than computers, painting and books keep me alive and in connection with the world around.
